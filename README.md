# GameWorld

## Introduction 

This GameWorld project was one of the things I worked on during college and we had to draw paths to gameworlds and also have linked descriptions for them.

## Technologies

* Java
* Data Structures
* Command-line
* Github

## What I've learned

While making the GameWorld I improved my Java syntax and commenting skills. I also improved my ability to use the Java collections class and its data structures. This project may have been small but it helped me improve the foundation of my skills in Java.
